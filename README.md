# Sunday-Staples

Welcome to Sunday Staples
Hello Staplers! This app was created in mind for people who would like to simplify their meal planning. This application lets you search several recipes based on a staple ingredient. Users can then save the recipes that interest them the most, add saved recipes to their shopping list, customize their shopping list, and view previous shopping lists. It also allows users to review recipes that they've saved, including an image upload section so the user can share their creation to compare it to the recipe image. As an additional feature, there is a nutrition search that will give you nutritional facts about the searched item. This application is your one stop shop to get your meal planning done!
